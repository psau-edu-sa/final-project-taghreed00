<h2> About the project: </h2>

In general, the project included many steps to build it, starting with providing a general background for the application X, formerly known as Twitter, and describing some of the problems solved by the application. <br>
Accordingly, we started to develop a business plan, followed by defining the requirements, and finally, in order to study and analyze the system more accurately, we used UML charts based on the requirements that were written.<br>
We used these graphs as a way to visually show the behavior and structure of the system, which allowed us to explain our thoughts more clearly. Through it, we were able to understand the relationships between the requirements and explain the steps needed to build this project.
